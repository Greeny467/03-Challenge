# 03-Challenge
## Information
### What is this?
In this module 3 challenge I was tasked with taking a coded webpage and implimenting new features.
The webpage itself is a password generator, which allows you to specify your desired password length, and what characters to be used.

### What I added
When I got the initial code, it was the finished css file, and the webpage looked the same, only without the input elements. 
The function used to write the password was unfinished, and I was tasked with finishing it. I added the input elements, a function to arange which 
character types were being used, a function to write the password itself, and all the responses, including errors.
